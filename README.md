# tk_offset
Add offset support to the Tkinter's Text widget and it's different methods (delete, tag_add, etc)

# TODO
- Make this a nice class
- Add support for 1:1 for f.seek, f.tell, at least as much as possible
- Make more example of how this can be used, for different context/purposes
- More interactive testing (mostly for me...it's fun)
- Add support for every other methods since I only supported the tag_add one for now (as the description says)
